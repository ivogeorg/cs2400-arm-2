		;		ARM Programming Assignment #2: 32 bit signed integer multiplier
		;
		;		Write a 32-bit SIGNED multiplier. It should take only a small modification to your
		;       unsigned version. Remember (-6)*(-6) = 36, (-6)*6 = -36.
		;		Use the standard shift-and-add operation.
		;		Use the two numbers as an example but write it so it works for any two 16-bit numbers.
		;		Write the result in the provided "fill" word.
		;		Indicate if there was a high-bit carry using the provided "fill" word.

		;		Your code here

;numbers	DCD		0xA0BCFF0D, 0xFFF0ADEA ; second multiplicand is NaN
numbers	DCD		0xA0BCFF0D, 0xF0F0ADEA
result	FILL		8
carry	FILL		4
